# final
This final project is a quiz meant for college students like me who buy plenty of food and struggle to eat it all. I love bananas and as a south indian, I am very protective of my banans- which are the one food I never waste. So this quiz helps any lazy student assess their banana usage and their efficiency at using bananas.
